So important notes
1. Install npm if you haven't, it is needed to run js stuff
2. Once you have npm, when git pulling/cloning, do
    npm Install
- to get all dependencies such as the dependency for sql
3. within the db-app folder make
 .env
file which is the environment variables, it is different depending on your
sql workbench server details
------------
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=fuckingpassword
DB_NAME=dbhr
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
-------------
- change to correct db name and also password
4. In React the main thing you have to study is useState and useEffect
5. Parameters being passed in react are called "props" so in case you see that term, thats what that means
6. When making your own pages, put this at the very top
- IMPORTANT!!!
'use client';
- this makes it interactable and not have to deal with serverside stuff
- you might be confused as to why you cant click buttons, etc.
